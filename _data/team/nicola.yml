proj_title: Power to gas - metagenomics and metabolic modeling for the optimization of anaerobic CO2 capture and green biomethane production
research_interests:
  - Development of a reliable strategy for the production of biomethane through biological biogas upgrading 
  - Investigation through metabolic modeling of the interspecies microbial dynamics in the anaerobic digestion microbiome 
  - Analysis of environmental parameters influencing the microbial community responsible for bio-methanation
