## gapseq

*Informed prediction and analysis of bacterial metabolic pathways and genome-scale networks*

### Purpose

gapseq is designed to combine metabolic pathway analysis with metabolic network reconstruction and curation. Based on genomic information and databases for pathways and reactions, gapseq can be used for:

- prediction of metabolic pathways from various databases
- transporter inference
- metabolic model construction (*genome-scale metabolic networks*)
- multi-step gap filling

## Eutropia

*Agent-based metabolic modelling of microbial communities in time and continuous Âµ-meter-scale space*

### Purpose

Eutropia is a R-package for cell agent-based metabolic modelling of microbial communities. It allows dynamic simulations of two-dimensional surface-attached cell communities. A few features of Eutropia, that you might find interesting:

- Complex polygons (also non-convex) as growth environment
- Extracellular enzymes
- Nutrient regimes
- Chemotaxis (attracting and repelling)
- Direct calculations of community assortment and segregation (see e.g. [Yanni et al. (2015) Current Biology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.03.068))
